Final Project
=============


I have been a fan of plays and musicals for a long time, and I would like to share my experiences on the ones that I loved the most. I will focus on to visually emphasize the unique part that made this play/musical special to me.


My first choice is the play *Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime* and the most interesting factor of this play was the usage of LED screens on the cubic stage and the futuristic lightings. The image that follows the mouse cursor is what the main character of this play follows through this entire plot, so I wanted to express that in design.


While this first example focused on the video and colors, another page will be about a play called *Capone Trilogy* which is a play done in an extremely small room rather than an actual stage, so it will have a completely different feeling but I will continue with the same theme of ‘theater on web’ feeling.


I designed my page to have black borders instead of being completely fullscreen since I wanted the page to have more of a theater-like effect. I am also planning to add more user-interactive features through javascript so that the users could be more involved in this experience. Main page is planned to include ticket icons done by svg to lead to each sub-pages and additional effects.
